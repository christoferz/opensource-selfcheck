Jan 28, 2013: the code is available!  Sorry for the delay!  Enjoy.

Based on Eric Melton's original self check code (http://code.google.com/p/open-source-self-check/), this version has been adapted to be run from a server across multiple machines.  Many upgrades have gone into this code, including:

- improved configuration files (most if not all settings can be set in one place)<br>
- streamlined database handling (improved stats recording, neater handling of db)<br>
- code has been thoroughly commented<br>
- removed some extraneous code to make processes more efficient<br>
- made sounds easier to handle<br>

Eric's code was phenomenal (it literally took me 5 minutes to set up for our library) but on the whole it has been difficult to troubleshoot as I was not familiar with the code.  We used his solution on a server from the start and although it worked immediately, improvements were made.<br>

Code should appear in early January 2013.
