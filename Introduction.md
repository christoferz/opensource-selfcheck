# Introduction #

Thank you for taking a look at this project.  Please leave comments for improvements or enhancements.  The code is fully documented and won't be as daunting as it might look.  I've tried to design it for non programmers, so much of the functionality is handled in one file and with True/False switches.

You're going to need to download both the source code and the Firefox file.  I kept them separate for ease moving forward (if updates are made and submitted).

Please do flip me an email to let me know you're using the software.  This is my first released project and I'm just interested if it gets used (and where).

Thanks

Christofer
