Based on Eric Melton's original self check code (http://code.google.com/p/open-source-self-check/), this version has been adapted to be run from a server across multiple machines. Many upgrades have gone into this code, including:

- improved configuration files (most if not all settings can be set in one place)
- streamlined database handling (improved stats recording, neater handling of db)
- code has been thoroughly commented
- removed some extraneous code to make processes more efficient
- made sounds easier to handle

Eric's code was phenomenal (it literally took me 5 minutes to set up for our library) but on the whole it has been difficult to troubleshoot as I was not familiar with the code. We used his solution on a server from the start and although it worked immediately, improvements were made.
